# Banking_Term_Deposit_Prediction
This notebook represents a couple of ML Models that predict whether a customer will invest in a term-deposit at the bank or not.

Through this notebook - Univariate analysis, outlier removal, binning, ILAT transformations and encoding have been explored along with the use of Chi-Squared and Anova
tests for feature selection.
  
Finally, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification algorithms are used for prediction. The performance has been analyzed with a confusion matrix from which
precision and recall have been calculated. The results have not been optimzed yet with hyperparameter tuning as the main aim of this project was Data Pre-Processing and EDA.
